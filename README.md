# Skeeball
This program is a digital version of the popular Skeeball game.

Created by: Allison and Siraju 

Based on the classic arcade game, our project is a digital version of Skeeball. Using a click and drag/fling feature, players roll the white ball up the screen aiming to hit one of the black targets. If the ball collides with a target the respective point value is added to the players score. If the player fails to hit a target the ball resets to its original position and 0 points are added to the score. There is no time limit or penalties so players can continue aiming infinitely to reach their personal high-score.
